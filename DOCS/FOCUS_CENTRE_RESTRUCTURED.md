## AlphaOS Philosophy: What MUST Be

> "The Focus Map helps you bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to be." — Elliott Hulse

### Purpose

**Monthly Mission** - Bridge between Frame (now) and Freedom (IPW) through actionable monthly steps.

**Position:** Frame → Freedom → **FOCUS (Monthly mission)** → Fire (weekly)

## What MUST Happen

### SHRINKING THE JOURNEY

**The Challenge:**
- Long journey between current reality and IPW
- Without breaking down into steps, feels overwhelming
- Goal seems out of reach

**The Solution:**
- Divide path into smaller steps
- Focus Map = immediate step in this quest
- Taking big vision and breaking down into smaller, actionable steps

### BUILDING THE FOUNDATION

**Monthly Focus = Foundation Building:**

1. **Habits:**
   - Daily actions that set the pace for your journey
   - Repetitive actions = backbone of progress over time

2. **Routines:**
   - Predictable pattern that keeps you on track
   - Dedicated time to work towards goals
   - Ensures always moving forward

3. **Additions:**
   - New tools, skills, or allies needed on journey
   - What to ADD to support climb

4. **Eliminations:**
   - Things holding you back that must be let go
   - What to REMOVE to enable progress
