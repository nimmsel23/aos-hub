**Core4** - 28-or-Die Daily Habits (Part of THE CORE)

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-10

---

## AlphaOS Philosophy: What MUST Be

> "From the beginning, humanity was given a divine gift—dominion. This wasn't just a command to control the world around us, but a deeper call to master ourselves." — AlphaOS (Chapter 13)

### Purpose

**28-or-Die Tracking** - Daily energy investment in ALL 4 Domains.

**The Gift of DOMINION:**
- Not about ruling others, but mastering yourself
- Command to "multiply and replenish" = expand potential + renew inner strength
- True power = self-dominion across all life areas

**Philosophy:** DOMINION entsteht durch Überwindung von Widerstand in ALLEN Lebensbereichen, nicht nur einem.

---

## The 4 Domains × 8 Tasks = 4 Points Daily

**Daily Formula:**
```
BODY (Fitness + Fuel)           = 1 point
BEING (Meditation + Memoirs)    = 1 point
BALANCE (Partner + Posterity)   = 1 point
BUSINESS (Discover + Declare)   = 1 point
────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL DAILY                     = 4 points
```

**Weekly Target:** 28 points (4 points/day × 7 days) = **"28 or die"**

**Mantra:** "Hit your four before the door to prep for war"

---

## Domain #1: BODY (Chapter 14)

### Philosophy: The Sacred Vessel

> "In the vast universe of our existence, we have one irreplaceable asset: our body. This vessel isn't just a tool—it's a temple."

**The Body Game:** Fitness + Fuel

**Key Insight:**
- Without body = just an observer, unable to truly experience life
- Most take body for granted until something goes wrong
- Body can be greatest ally or biggest obstacle

---

### Task 1: FITNESS (🏋️) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "Did you sweat today?"

**Philosophy:**
- Movement is life (stagnant water breeds disease)
- Bodies built to move: run, jump, push, pull, dance
- NOT about perfect image—about respect for this machine
- Daily commitment to keep body in top condition

**What Counts:**
- Running, yoga, brisk walk, strength training
- ANY activity that makes you sweat
- 20+ minutes of physical exertion

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily act of movement
- Fitness = 50% of BODY domain score

---

### Task 2: FUEL (🍽️) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "What did I nourish my body with today?"

**Philosophy:**
- What you eat affects energy, mood, brainpower, health
- In daily hustle, easy to fill body with junk
- NOT about strict diets or denial
- About making small, intentional choice to care for yourself

**What Counts:**
- Conscious choice to eat well (right proportions)
- Example: Green smoothie, balanced meal
- Simple act of putting GOOD food in body

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily act of nourishment
- Fuel = 50% of BODY domain score

**BODY TOTAL = 1 point** (Fitness 0.5 + Fuel 0.5)

---

## Domain #2: BEING (Chapter 15)

### Philosophy: The Silent Pilot

> "At the core of our being is the soul—our silent guide. We are not just bodies living in a world; we are souls experiencing life."

**The Being Game:** Meditation + Memoirs

**Key Insight:**
- Soul drives actions, emotions, thoughts
- To tap into soul's power = connect through practice
- Body is vessel, soul is compass

---

### Task 3: MEDITATION (🧘) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "Did I meditate today?"

**Philosophy:**
- More than mental exercise—connection with soul
- Step away from noise → journey inward
- Brings peace, insight, deeper self-understanding
- Centers you, grounds you, aligns internal compass

**What Counts:**
- 20 minutes daily meditation
- ANY form: active meditation, mental prayer, mindfulness
- Quiet mind → hear soul's voice

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily act of connection (20 min)
- Meditation = 50% of BEING domain score

---

### Task 4: MEMOIRS (📝) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "Did I write today?"

**Philosophy:**
- Meditation = LISTEN to soul
- Memoirs = EXPRESS what you've heard
- Private space for thoughts and reflections
- Getting what's inside OUT

**What Counts:**
- Basic journaling (daily experiences, challenges, victories)
- Strategic stacking (powerful way to process and progress)
- Writing reflects inner world → brings clarity

**The Power:**
- Memoirs = footprints left by soul
- Shows path taken through life
- Offers guidance for future

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily act of creation (writing)
- Memoirs = 50% of BEING domain score

**BEING TOTAL = 1 point** (Meditation 0.5 + Memoirs 0.5)

---

## Domain #3: BALANCE (Chapter 16)

### Philosophy: Life's Intricate Dance

> "Life pulls us away from people who should be at center of our world: our women and children. Balance brings us back to these connections."

**The Balance Game:** Partner + Posterity

**Key Insight:**
- Even with best intentions, loved ones can feel in background
- Love needs to be EXPRESSED and celebrated
- Each relationship = bank account (gratitude = currency)

---

### Task 5: PARTNER (👥) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "Did I express gratitude to Person #1 today?"

**Philosophy:**
- Daily deposits of appreciation
- NOT big dramatic gestures
- Simple gestures, kind words, moments of acknowledgment
- Goal: keep relationship account full and balanced

**What Counts:**
- Use these statements in some form:
  - "I love you."
  - "I honor you."
  - "I appreciate you."
- Ask: "What makes me grateful for this person TODAY?"
- Find SPECIFIC reason and express it
- Via text, email, voice note, video, or handwritten note

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily deposit for spouse/partner/Person #1
- Partner = 50% of BALANCE domain score

---

### Task 6: POSTERITY (💑) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "Did I express gratitude to Person #2 today?"

**Philosophy:**
- Same as Partner, but for children (or second important person)
- Children need to FEEL appreciated, not just assume it
- Build legacy through daily connection

**What Counts:**
- Same as Partner: "I love/honor/appreciate you"
- For ONE of your children (if you have kids)
- OR any second important person in your life
- Find SPECIFIC reason for gratitude today

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily deposit for child/Person #2
- Posterity = 50% of BALANCE domain score

**BALANCE TOTAL = 1 point** (Partner 0.5 + Posterity 0.5)

**Note:** If no wife or children, choose ANY two people. Friends, colleagues, new acquaintances. Foundation = two deliberate deposits of gratitude every day.

---

## Domain #4: BUSINESS (Chapter 17)

### Philosophy: The Business of Life

> "Money matters. Without it, our hands are tied, limiting our ability to reach the life we want."

**The Business Game:** Discover + Declare

**Key Insight:**
- Money fuels dreams
- BIG difference between handling money vs mastering wealth game
- 4 Roles: Making, Keeping, Growing, Leaving Legacy
- Mission: Discover and Declare

---

### Task 7: DISCOVER (🔍) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "Did I learn something new about money/business today?"

**Philosophy:**
- Dive into financial knowledge
- NOT random learning—mission to find what CLICKS
- Learn until insight sparks revelation ("aha" moment)
- Goal NOT to finish book/video—to learn until something connects

**What Counts:**
- Engage with material: money, marketing, sales, leadership
- ANY skill that grows wealth
- Keep going until "aha" moment
- When you find key insight → STOP (mission complete)

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily act of study (until revelation)
- Discover = 50% of BUSINESS domain score

---

### Task 8: DECLARE (📣) = 0.5 points

**Required Question:** "Did I share what I learned today?"

**Philosophy:**
- Once you found key insight → SHARE IT
- Teaching what you learned makes it STICK
- Turn insights into action → translates to real financial growth

**What Counts:**
- Write it down (personal note)
- OR post on social media
- OR teach someone
- ANY act of declaring solidifies knowledge

**Earning the Point:**
- ✅ **0.5 points** = Daily act of share (teaching)
- Declare = 50% of BUSINESS domain score

**BUSINESS TOTAL = 1 point** (Discover 0.5 + Declare 0.5)

---

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

---

### Power Tracking

**Philosophy:**
- Consistent tracking amplifies commitment
- Every point = personal growth, progress, alignment with life's vision
- Journey of evolution

**Why Track:**
1. **Accountability** - You see what you did (or didn't do)
2. **Patterns** - Reveals which domains you neglect
3. **Momentum** - Streaks motivate continued effort
4. **DOMINION** - Proof of mastery across ALL 4 domains

**Critical:**
- Without tracking = vague intentions
- WITH tracking = concrete evidence of DOMINION
